# Brain_Tumor_Detection

## Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from medical imaging data. The workflow includes image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
Public brain MRI dataset

## DL Approach
- Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Image Classification

## Results
The CNN model successfully classifies brain tumor images with good performance.

## Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy using data augmentation
- Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
